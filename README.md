This Rock, Paper, Scissors game features a learning
AI that predicts the player's next move based on their
previous choices. 
The game includes a scoring system, lives, and tracks the
player’s and computer's wins, losses, and draws. As the player continues
playing, the AI adapts, making the game more challenging by attempting
to counter repeated patterns in the player's moves.
